        <h3>What Exactly Are These Crazy Kids Up to?</h3>
        <p>
          EH9 is like a playgroup for adults. It’s quite a simple idea:
          Speciality Coffee, Bakes and Good People. That’s what we’re about. The
          most important thing to us, is that the local community have somewhere
          consistent and informal to escape, get some work done, listen to our
          OONCY tunes and catch up with their mates. The Wi-Fi is quick, and we
          have loads of plug points, so no more procrastinating, you!
        </p>
        <p>
          The Menu is focused because that keeps everyone happy. We’re talking;
          less waste, fresh products, happy baristas and efficient service. For
          food, think bagels, vegan pastries, the world’s best brownies and
          banging cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ll always have a full range of speciality coffee for people to try
          (including filter coffee and espresso) and even more options on the
          retail shelf for you to brew at home. If coffee isn’t your thing,
          we’ve got yah covered with tea, soft drinks and hot chocolate.

        <h3>What we’re about</h3>
        <p>
          An Edinburgh postcode, in the West End of Dundee. Pretty confusing,
          huh? The EH9 ESPRESSO concept takes heavy influence from my
          experiences of the coffee scene in Edinburgh. There are countless
          independents, all rocking their own space in Scotland’s capital city
          and I have enjoyed this both as a barista and a coffee enthusiast. I
          started a job as a barista in a local coffee shop, as a student, to
          fund my studies but quickly fell in love with the culture and
          community that surround coffee shops.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personally, I find real comfort in the bustle of a busy coffee shop
          and have had several reminders of the importance of ‘third spaces’ for
          local communities over the years. The bustling coffee scene in
          Edinburgh has created a rising tide effect, lifting customer
          engagement, pushing standards, and supporting the coffee industry,
          which is now world renowned for its quality. I wanted to create a
          little of bit of that here, in Dundee, as the city continues to
          increase in vibrancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of EH9 as the coffee equivalent of a ‘little Italy’ restaurant.
          As corporate as it sounds, we’re here to be a lot more than just a
          coffee shop. We’re here to drive engagement in coffee culture
          throughout the city as we truly believe in the benefits it has for the
          community – Fraser (owner)

        <h3>Where you’ll find us</h3>
        <p>
          Where you’ll find us You’ll find our Coffee Bar in the West End of
          Dundee, at 248/250 Perth Rd, DD1 4LL.
        </p>
        <p>
          We count ourselves very lucky that we’re grouped with a whole load of
          independent businesses down the Perth Road, it has everything from
          vintage clothes stores, streetwear brands, eco larders, record shops,
          indie barbers and green grocers. We might be biased, but we think that
          they’re brilliant for browsing with a coffee in hand.
